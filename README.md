For this final project, I worked with a Thoracic Surgery Dataset working on a binomial classification problem.
Attached to this repository you may find a PowerPoint which was presented during class, as well as full code in R. The code 
has been commented on in the file itself. Also included in the R code is other commented out code which was attempted to obtain a 
better AUC. 

Thank you,
James
